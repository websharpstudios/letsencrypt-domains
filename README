= Contingency Keys for HTTP Public Key Pinning =

We create a second set of keys for all our services, so we can pin keys to both
the one automatically generated on our letsencrypt host and the backup key.

If you do not have a backup-keys directory, get it from git:
 git clone pauli.torproject.org:/srv/puppet.torproject.org/git/tor-backup-keys.git backup-keys

After adding a new name to ./domains, run ./bin/manage-backup-keys create
and ./bin/manage-backup-keys verify.  Find the passphrase in
tor-passwords/000-backup-keys.
