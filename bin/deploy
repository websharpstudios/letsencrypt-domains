# The hook script (indicated in the config.sh file or the --hook/-k command
# line argument) gets four arguments: an operation name (clean_challenge,
# deploy_challenge, or deploy_cert) and some operands for that. For
# deploy_challenge $2 is the domain name for which the certificate is required,
# $3 is a "challenge token" (which is not needed for dns-01), and $4 is a token
# which needs to be inserted in a TXT record for the domain.
